The accomplishment of this work happens thanks to people, who I mention here. I thank here Markus V{\"o}lter, who
first came with the idea to add C++ to mbeddr after a MoDeVVa'12 workshop in Innsbruck, for initial prototyping the 
Projectional C++ implementation and following guiding and advising for my work. I thank Domenik Pavletic from mbeddr 
project for practical help, provided to me, when facing various technical difficulties while using 
MPS and mbeddr. I thank Bernd Kolb for taking part in the discussion on Projectional C++ and the way 
it has to be developed further. And I thank Alexander Shatalin for a long session of MPS debugging, 
which helped me to move on with Projectional C++.

The theoretical part and the message of this work have been shaped thanks to the advisor of this work, 
Dr. rer. nat. Daniel Ratiu. He gave me constant support, re-reading my work, and making my thoughts, put on the paper,
being more clear and descriptive. 

I thank PD Dr. rer. nat. habil. Berhard Sch{\"a}tz for giving me a broad freedom on picking an interesting topic for 
me and assisting on the work accomplishment.

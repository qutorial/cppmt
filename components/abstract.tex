In this work we describe the process of adding the \cpppl\ support to the \mbdp, an implementation of the
C programming language with extensions in a projectional language engineering environment, \jbmps. 

While implementing the \cpppl\ some well-known pitfalls of the language are taken into account
in an attempt to build a better C++ language flavor. Several analyses are implemented to improve
the programming experience of the end user. Lessons learned include generalized principles, 
which a language engineer could use to improve a language while recreating it in a projectional language 
engineering environment; an anlysis of support for language modularity and extensibility  by \jbmps;
research on the typical problems occuring while implementing analyses in \jbmps.

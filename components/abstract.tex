In this work we describe the process of adding the \cpppl\ support to \mbdp, an implementation of the
C programming language with extensions in a projectional language engineering environment, \jbmps. 
While implementing the \cpppl\ several well-known pitfalls of the language are taken into account
in an attempt to build a better C++ language flavor. Various analyses are implemented to improve
the programming experience for the end user. Lessons learned from this experience are described finally.
They include generalized principles, which could be used to improve a language while recreating it in a 
projectional language engineering environment; support of language modularity and extensibility  by \jbmps;
problems of building analyses and their complexity together with potential ways to resolve them in the future.

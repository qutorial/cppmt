\chapter{Conclusion}

% C++ built

% Incremental approach in building languages without interfering (non-invasive way) researched with advantages and 
% difficulties

% MPS improvements suggested after the extensibility was researched

% General Projectional Approach Techniques figurred out 


% The diffiulty is high interaction of components with each other in C++.
% For example copying and assignment, with method implemented check - depricators in private
% Virtual and pure virtual functions with inheritance
% Virtuality, overloads and is implemented check
% Inheritance and virtuality with abstract classes and instantiation - new, new array, function param, return type.
% Namespaces clash with classes and modules, exporting, typing 

% - So the difficulty is to keep the whole thing modular, but observable - more or less one funciton in one place (checks for abstract named the same).

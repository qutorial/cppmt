\chapter{C and C++}
\label{chapter:CAndCpp}

Initially C++ appeared to be an extesnion to the C language, called ``C with Classes'' \cite{cwithclasses}. Till now the high degree
of commonality can be found between the two languages. Mainly, the most of the C code is going to be valid C++ code. 

\section{Reference Type and Boolean Type}

Among primitive types and operations there are two major differences relevant to practice.
They are discussed in the following subsections.

\subsection{Reference Type}

Reference type is basically a new construct in C++ which represent the old notion of pointer in C with a different syntax.
The syntax for a variable of type \cc{T} can be used with the variable of type reference to \cc{T}, or \cc{\&T} as it is designated in C++.
It comes especially handy when passing arguments to methods by reference, which avoids creating a copy of an object to pass 
by value.
\cpp{Reference Type in a Copy Constructor}{copyconstructor}

The value of the reference type in C++ is bigger however, than just a new syntax for pointers. A constant reference to a class object 
has to be used in constructor to give it a special meaning of a copy constructor, as the \rl{copyconstructor} demonstrates.


\subsection{Boolean Type}

% Need in C++
The \cpppl\ has a special \cc{bool} type to represent the two logical values. There is no such type in C.

%Implementation
No matter, the \cc{bool} type is not present in C, for the convenience of the user the \mb\ C implementation introduced a type \cc{bool}.

%Limitations




\section{Modules}


%In C++
%Implicit Assignment from void*
%Freeing arrays: new[] and delete[]
%declare functions before use


%TODO : Exceptions!

%Sure, both can clear trees out of your way, but...

%In terms of special:

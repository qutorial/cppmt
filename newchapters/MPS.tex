\msnozoom{mpsif}{\jbmps\ User Interface, \mpsid{IfStatement} \Rg{concept}}

\jbmps\ stands for JetBrains Meta Programming System. In this \Rg{ide}-like software it is possible to develop \Rgp{dsl}.
The approach taken in \jbmps\ is rather unique, and it is considered to be advantageous in many ways, \cite{Voelter:MoDELS:2010}.


% No way to extend mbeddr otherwise
% Thus \jbmps\ is a good suitable technology for the practical implementation of the \MT\ goal.

In general, the way the language is described in \jbmps\ corresponds to the way, the projectional editing is described in general 
in the \rsec{modularlang}.
Here we will describe the process in practical details, as it is crucial for understanding the practical part of this \MT.

In this section we will go through a definition of one \rg{concept}, describing the facilities, \jbmps\ provides to support
it. Each \rg{concept} is described by several views on it. 



Among such views there are a \rg{concept} declaration (or language structure) view, an editor view, a behavior view, a constraints view, 
a type system view, a generator view and few more views. As a language consists mostly of the included in it \rgp{concept}, 
the whole language is presented by the mentioned views as well, where each view on the language contains all views of the kind on each language \rg{concept}. 
Left part of the \fig{mpsif} demonstrates the views on the \mpslang{statements} language.

% The representation of a new language created in concepts and views to them, present a seamless approach to creating 
% a new language with a projectional editor for it.

The \mbp\ is a software, separate from \jbmps\, but based on it, representing an extensible C language implementation with extensions.
We will use \rgp{concept} from the \mbp throughout this section as examples to demonstrate \jbmps. Different C language parts are going to be 
decomposed into \rgp{concept}, and these \rgp{concept} are going to be defined using \jbmps. The reader should not confuse though the \mbp\ and 
\jbmps\ itself: the former is a software, developed in the latter. The \mbdp\ and is used to demonstrate \jbmps\ in this section.

Interestingly enough, \rgp{dsl} are used in order to define new languages. Each view features a language used to describe a new \rg{concept}.
It is demonstrated in the following sections.

\subsection{Concept Declaration}
\label{mpsconceptdeclaration}

\Rgp{concept}, as it is described in the \rsec{modularlang}, represent a class-like types for nodes of an \rg{ast}. This terminology is kept in \jbmps\ and 
MPS concept has the same meaning as \rg{concept} term used in the \rsec{modularlang}. We use the term ``concept'' both in general, to describe an \rg{ast} node type,
and in particular referring to an MPS concept.

% Repeats \rsec{modularlang}
%
% One defines a language in it not through the canonical grammar approach, but instead through defining so called concepts, and relationships 
% between them similar to those in ER diagrams. A logical part of a language can be made a concept. 
% Related to C++, class, method declaration, field declaration can be represented as a concept. 

The \fig{mpsif}, on the right part, demonstrates a declaration of the \mpsid{IfStatement} \rg{concept} from the \mbdr\ \mpslang{statements} language.
It corresponds to the \cc{if} statement of the C language.

At first, the \rg{concept} is named, and a \rg{baseconcept} is defined. For example, the \mpsid{IfStatment} \rg{concept} inherits from 
the \mpsid{Statement} \rg{concept}. 
This allows a node of the  \mpsid{IfStatement} \rg{concept} to be used at any place at which a node of the parent \mpsid{Statement} \rg{concept} 
could be used, and inherits, like in object-oriented  programming, all data and behavior of the \mpsid{Statement}.

Next, it is defined, which interfaces the \rg{concept} is going to implement. For example, by implementing \mpsid{ISteppableContext}, the \mpsid{IfStatement}
supports the \mbdr\ debugger when stepping in the body of the \mpsid{IfStatement}.

The ``instance can be root'' property defines, if it is meaningful to create a \rg{concept} without a parent \rg{concept} for it. In the case
of \mpsid{IfStatment} it does not make sense, as the statement should belong to some block. The \cc{true} value can be used, e.g. for modules,
as they do not have any outer nodes, and can be seen as a document in \jbmps.

The ``properties'' part defines if the described \rg{concept} instances should have some primitive type data fields (string, boolean, integer).
An example of a property could be a \mpsid{name} property of a variable declaration. The \mpsid{IfStatement} \rg{concept} does not specify any 
properties, neither does it inherit any from the \mpsid{Statement} concept.

The ``children'' section describe which nodes can be children of \mpsid{IfStatement} on an \rg{ast}. Each child is assigned with a role and cardinality. 
For example, a node of the \mpsid{IfStatement} \rg{concept} should have exactly one child of the \mpsid{Expression} \rg{concept}, 
it has a role ``condition''.

The ``references'' section describes in the similar way as in the ``children'' section, which nodes could be referenced by the node of a given \rg{concept}.
Referencing can be used, to bind a given node, to a node, located somewhere else on an \rg{ast}. As an example, a variable usage in an expression shall reference
the variable declaration, to express precisely, which variable is used.

Finally, some attributes of a \rg{concept} follow, which do not have a primary importance for the discussion here. The ``alias'' is used to 
name a \rg{concept} in a short way, to allow for quick instantiation in the editor. The ``short description'' is shown to hint a programmer on the
alias meaning. A \rg{concept} can be made abstract in the ``concept properties'' section. Abstract \rgp{concept} are purely used in inheritance 
to create other non-abstract concepts with a common parent.

\jbmps\ separately allows to define so-called \rgp{interfaceconcept}. \Rgp{interfaceconcept} are \rgp{concept} which can not be instantiated, but 
which serve as a base for inheritance and implementing various declared by them behavior interfaces. A \rg{concept} can have only one base \rg{concept},
but can inherit from/implement many \rgp{interfaceconcept}. A reference or a child relationship can be typed with an \rg{interfaceconcept}.

\subsection{Editor View}
\label{mpseditor}


\msnozoom{mpsifeditor}{Editor View for the \mpsid{IfStatement} \Rg{concept}}

The editor view, \fig{mpsifeditor}, is designed to give a look for a node of a \rg{concept}, and a way to input it. This is where the projection of an \rg{ast} node is defined. 
As editors are mostly defined to look like text, a program in the \cpppl implemented in \jbmps\ looks almost like a regular C++ code.

In the editor view one defines an editor for a \rg{concept}. \jbmps\ introduces here a bit confusing terminology, calling one editor for a given
\rg{concept} an ``editor concept''. Thus an error message ``An editor concept not found for a concept X'' would mean that no editor
has been defined for the \rg{concept} \mpsid{X} in the editor view for it. In this work we call the content in the editor view for a \rg{concept} \mpsid{X} an 
``editor for the \rg{concept} \mpsid{X}''. Similar terminology applies to all the following views related to a single \rg{concept}.

The editor for a \rg{concept} defines a visual representation for a node of the \rg{concept}, using special syntax. For example, the 
\fig{mpsifeditor} defines an editor concept for \mpsid{IfStatement}. At first the ``constant'' non-changeable by a programmer text is given, which is ``if'' and ``(''. Then
the child \mpsid{condition} is referenced, so that after the ``if('' a user will be able to input an expression for the condition of the \cc{if} statement.
The editor can be configured to show or hide some parts of a node, depending on some condition, e.g. hiding \cc{else} part of the \cc{if} statement, if it 
is not defined. An editor concept is also responsible for all the interaction, a user experiences, when editing a node of the \rg{concept}, 
to which this editor belongs.

\subsection{Behavior View}

The behavior view, can be used to define certain methods for a \rg{concept}. A \rg{concept} is represented there similar to a Java class, and
it is possible to define methods in a Java-like language. \Rg{concept} inheritance is taken into account like in Java. 

A \rg{concept} constructor can be defined there to initialize by default a newly created node of a \rg{concept}.

\msnozoom{mpslocvarrefbeh}{Behavior View for the \mpsid{LocalVarRef} \Rg{concept}}

The \fig{mpslocvarrefbeh} shows the behavior of the \mpsid{LocalVarRef} \rg{concept}. This \rg{concept} represents in the
\mbp\ C language an expression, referencing a local variable. The local variable declaration is stored as a reference \mpsid{var}
in the \rg{concept} nodes.

Two convenience methods are defined for the \mpsid{LocalVarRef} \rg{concept}, to get an easy access to local variable properties.


\subsection{Constraints View}
\label{mpsconstraints}

\msnozoom{mpsidnameconstr}{Editor View for the \mpsid{IfStatement} \Rg{concept}}

The constraints view can be used, to limit in a desirable way \rg{concept} property values and relationships, a node of the \rg{concept} can 
have to other nodes. It is possible to take into account any sort of a context, and thus create a context-aware/sensitive \rg{concept}.

The \fig{mpsidnameconstr} demonstrates constraints defined for a property \mpsid{name}. This is a property of an 
\rg{interfaceconcept} called \mpsid{IIdentifierNamedConcept}. All \rgp{concept} which must have a name, confirming to the identifier naming restrictions, can implement the \mpsid{IIdentifierNamedConcept},
to immediately get the desired characteristic.

The \mpsid{name} property is programmatically restricted by the use of Java-like code snippet, \fig{mpsidnameconstr}. In a similar way
relationships to children and referents can be restricted.

It is possible to create a pure Java class within \jbmps\ language, and use it in almost any \rg{concept} view in \jbmps. 
The \fig{mpsidnameconstr} demonstrates a use of the \cc{CIdentifierHelper} class within the constraints for the \rg{interfaceconcept}
\mpsid{IIdentifierNamedConcept} to check a name property value on collisions with the C language keywords.

Constraints play an important role for the editor work. A programmer is presented with a list of choices, when inputting
a new node on an \rg{ast}. The choice of nodes is \emph{defined} with the constraints. Such constrains are called ``scoping constrains'' in 
\jbmps. A scope can be defined for a child or a reference of a \rg{concept}. It is represented by a procedure, which takes a node 
in a context, and returns a list of possible children/referents after analyzing the given context. 
Exactly the resulting list is going to be presented to the programmer, as an options list for auto-completion, when building 
a child or a referent for the node.

\subsection{Type System View}
\label{mpsts}
\jbmps\ has a special support for creation of typed languages. Types are mainly used in expressions. An expressions may count on 
a certain sub-expression to have a given type, or a type, compatible with it. Whenever the expectation does not meet the reality,
a warning or error can be displayed to a programmer. 

\msnozoom{mpsternaryts}{Type System View for the \mpsid{TernaryExpression} \Rg{concept}}

A \rg{concept}, representing nodes, which can have type in \mbdr, inherits from the \mpsid{ITyped} \rg{interfaceconcept}. 
In the type system view a code in a special language has to be put, which will define the type, or type comparison rules, for the \rg{concept}.
Moreover, the type system language can be used to infer a type for a given node,  see the \fig{mpsternaryts}.

The \fig{mpsternaryts}, demonstrates a use of the \jbmps\ type system language to infer a type of the \mpsid{TernaryExpression} \Rg{concept}
node. The syntax is on the one hand self-explanatory when reading, but, on the other hand, can be rather confusing when crafting.

When none of the existing type system rules can resolve a given typing problem, the so-called replacement
rule can be invoked in \jbmps. Replacement rules are defined for a given \rg{concept}. A snippet of Java-like
code must be given to explicitly analyze a node and assign a type to it.


\subsection{Non-Type-System Checks}
\label{mpsnontschecks}

Additional to the type system and constraints limitations on an \rg{ast} structure can be put via implementing 
non-type-system rules. In this work we often call them simply ``checks''.

For a given \rg{concept} a code snippet can be given, to check all nodes of the \rg{concept}. After the 
check is performed, there is a chance to mark a node as an error node, or create a warning on the node.
It is possible to provide some textual hint for a language user, to identify a reason of the error or warning, 
see the \fig{abstractinstance} for an example.

Non-type-system rules are used in this work to create \rgp{preventiveanalysis}, and are discussed additionally in the Section 
\ref{reportinganalysis}. Extensibility for checks is evaluated as extensibility for analyses, in the Section \ref{analysesext}.

\subsection{TextGen View}

To make a use of a code in a projectional editor, further tools must be invoked on it, e.g. parser, compiler, etc.
Normally they work with a textual representation of the code. In order to obtain the textual code from an \rg{ast} in the projectional
editor generators are invoked. 

The generators can be of two kinds. The first kind of generators is dedicated to transform an \rg{ast} in one \rg{dsl} into
another \rg{ast} represented in a, usually, lower-level language. The second kind of generators is dedicated to transform an \rg{ast} into text.
Such generators are called ``\rgp{textgen}'' in \jbmps.

\msnozoom{mpsbinexptextgen}{TextGen View for the \mpsid{BinaryExpression} \Rg{concept}}

The \fig{mpsbinexptextgen} demonstrates how a node of the \mpsid{BinaryExpression} \rg{concept} is converted to a text. It is noteworthy 
to say, that when rendering to a text the \mpsid{left} and the \mpsid{right} sub-expressions, the corresponding expression \rgp{textgen}
for them are invoked, making the text generation recursive.


\subsection{Generator View}
\label{generators}
The generator view is one of the most complex \jbmps\ views. A language engineer uses this view to define, how an \rg{ast} composed
in one language, has to be transformed into an \rg{ast} in another language in \jbmps. Alternatively, it is used to define, how higher-level
language extensions should be transformed to the basic constructions of a language, extended by them.

In this work we mostly use \Rgp{textgen} to produce a textual C++ code, when programming in the projectional editor has completed.
Thus, the generator view does not have a strong connection to the present work. We do not describe it in details here.

\subsection{Intentions}
\label{intentions}

\jbmps\ \rgp{intention} are special procedures which can be used for automatic manipulations on an \rg{ast} with a node of a given \rg{concept}.

\msnozoom{mpsconstintention}{Toggle Const Property for a \mpsid{Type} \Rg{intention}}

The \fig{mpsconstintention} demonstrates an intention, used to modify the \cc{const} property of a node, belonging to 
the \mpsid{Type} \rg{concept}. 

For an \rg{intention} to be defined, one has to name it, specify a \rg{concept}, to which the \rg{intention} is applicable,
provide a textual description for it, and finally specify a desired effect. 

There is also a special kind of \rgp{intention}, called ``error intentions''. They are not anyhow fundamentally different 
from the usual \rgp{intention}, except their special purpose to fix an error, when one occurs. 
Error \rgp{intention} are visualized using a red bulb icon in \jbmps.

Intentions are accessible in the projectional editor from a context menu, when focused on a target node, see the \fig{classintentions}. They represent 
a useful mechanism to support a programmer with various automations, including automatic code generation.

\msnozoom{classintentions}{Intentions Available for the \mpsid{Class} \Rg{concept}}

\subsection{Other MPS Instruments}
\label{othermpsinstruments}

\jbmps\ provides other instruments to enhance languages. 

\Rgp{action} are used to automate node deletions or editing. For example, deleting an array indexing expression, could be made
to provide a substitution, an array expression itself, not indexed. Such behavior may seem more natural to a programmer, used to text editing.

\jbmps\ provides a special support for refactorings. Special code snippets in a Java-like language can automate routine operations.
As an example, a procedure of factoring out a local variable from an expression can be taken.

Additionally, it is possible to extend functionality of an editor under construction via creating special \jbmps\ plug-ins. 
It can be in particular useful to implement some complex \rgp{analysisondemand}.

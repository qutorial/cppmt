\declsec{Comparison with Textual Approach}{comparison}

% Compare work with textual editor
% Compare the way analysis is performed
% Compare the naturality for the programmer
% Compare flexibility
% About direct compilation without generating text code
% Amount of typing and code generation
% Extensibility and higher level construction
% Moving code around is easy locally, but difficult from module to module
% Compare the version control Language And Code itself - different
% Refactorings require cool parser and are not implemented VS2010 new parser adoption
% Compare naming conventions

% .h and .cpp files vs modules - annoying to keep h and cpp in sync. Modules just do it.


\declsec{Generalized Principles of the Projectional Approach}{genprinciples}

In this chapter I formulate some of the general principles, which can be taken into
account when designing new languages in the projectional editors.

\subsection{Targeting Semantics}
%No matter what you generate to, you should target semantics - way to cover the abstraction gap

\subsection{Store More Information}
% More information can and SHOULD be stored than is needed for generation.
% Example is the overridden method link in the override

% Disadvantage - native code compatibility

\subsection{Configuration as a Part of Source Code}
% Configuration (as naming conventions) is nice to store with code! 
% Usually editor preferences are not shared like in eclipse, but this can enforce standards
% Another example would be the build configuration indeed.

\subsection{Hide Redundant Syntax}
% Don't show to the programmer semicolons and similar.

%TODO More?

\declsec{Projectional Language Extensibility}{extensibility}
% Extensibility of different languages to create a concept is discussed here.


% Structure - inheritance like (but confusion with base concept and inmplements)

% Editor - one only, can't be changed, in MPS3.0 - to be researched

% Constraints - no way to change nicely, but possible (IIdentifier Named concept, Cpp reserved words, get problem (find about it Markus letter) )
% Also constrain LocVar decl to not allow abstract classes - not possible, have to use check.


% Behavior - nice, like Java

% Textgen - nicely

% Generators - not related ?

% Actions and Intentions - not needed ? Or? How to forbid an intention on something?


%TODO Talk about the replacement rule
% Typesystem - pain! Replacement rule


%Summary in a shape of a table

\declsec{Analyses and Complexity}{analysesandcomplexity}

%Take one analysis, analyze complexity, figure out runtimes, MPS things

% Analysis can go on the syntax tree
% Which analysis can be needed in general
% The analysis can take time, online running complexity
% Naming conventions and regular expressions

% Analysis for abstract classes instantiation can happen very often, and is complex.

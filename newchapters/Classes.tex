\declsec{C++ Object-Oriented Programming}{oop}

The \cpppl\ is a multi-paradigm programming language. The ability to support the object-oriented programming,
is incorporated via classes support. 

A class represents a new type in the \cpppl. Each class may have data in a 
form of fields, and behavior in a form of methods. Two types of methods are special for
C++ - constructors and destructors, they have special meaning and syntax.

Encapsulation is enabled via governing access permissions to fields and methods of a class.
The access control is governed with a creation of \cc{public}, \cc{protected} and \cc{private}
class sections.

Inheritance is implemented in C++ via allowing each class to have one, or even many base classes.
Inheritance from a base class is performed under a certain access control modifier. There is no pure notion 
of an interface, but rather \rg{abstract} classes are introduced.

Polymorphism is implemented via a pointer-to-class type compatibility over inheritance-connected classes.

The implementation of these C++ features in a projectional editor environment is discussed in the
following sections.

\subsubsection{Visibility Sections}
\label{visibilitysections}



\cppproblem

Instead of declaring visibility a modifier for individual class members (C\#, Java), visibility sections are created
in C++. The sections can be opened with a string \cc{private:}, \cc{protected:} or \cc{public:}
within a class declaration, and closed when another section is opened or when the class declaration
ends. This allows a user to open and close the same section multiple times and declare sections
without any particular order. This can be error-prone and confusing.

Various coding guidelines (\cite{cppclasslayout}, \cite{googlecppstyle}) exist to enforce some 
restrictions on the visibility sections. In particular, the sections are allowed to be opened only once. This ensures, that a
reader of the code will see an interface of a class (public section) in one place,
``contents'' of the class (private section) in one place, and opportunities to access members in
an inheriting class (protected section) in one place, without a need to search through
the whole class declaration.

Another typical requirement in coding standards, is the order of the sections. Usually the public 
section is required to be the first, for the class users to see immediately the (public) interface,
the class provides.

\ms{webpage}{Sample Class Type Declaration}


The \fig{webpage}, shows an example class declaration implemented in \pcpp.
The \mpsid{Class} \rg{concept} has the visibility sections as children. Each section is given a separate role 
(see the Section \ref{mpsconceptdeclaration}) and can appear 0 or 1 time. The editor for the \mpsid{Class} \rg{concept} 
orders the visibility sections so, that the public section always comes first, if present, 
followed by the private and finally the protected sections, when present.

The creation of a section is made with the a of \rgp{intention}. The user
uses \emph{Alt+Enter} combination on a class declaration to create visibility sections.
It should be more practical and fast for the user, compared to typing a keyword, a colon and
indenting the result.

% Limitation
A question arises on how to support another way to represent a class, so that it will reflect
requirements from a different coding standard. And as a way to resolve it a definition of 
another editor for the \mpsid{Class} \rg{concept} can be offered. Unfortunately, the current version of \jbmps\ 2.5
does not support a definition of multiple editors for the same concept. This limitation however
is addressed in the newer \jbmps\ 3.0 version, which was not tested completely with \mbdr\ by the time
this work was made.


\subsubsection{Constructors}
\label{classconstructors}

\cppproblem

Constructors of a class are special methods of a class, used to construct the class instances. 

Constructors have special syntax and no return type, being similar to class methods otherwise. Constructors gain an additional 
value, however, when participating in type transformations. Namely, when
a constructor of a class \cc{B} exist from a type \cc{T}, instances of the type \cc{T} can be used whenever
the \cc{B} class instance is required. The constructor will be \emph{implicitly} called and a temporary object
of class \cc{B} is going to be created as a mediator. 

Thus constructors extend the type system of the C++ language, adding conversion rules to it. 
Since this type extension can not be easily observed, as multiple consequent implicit conversions can take place, 
it is highly possible to get various \emph{run-time} errors or unexpected behavior. 

\cpp{Example of an Implicit Constructor Error}{implicit}

The \rl{implicit} demonstrates a simplified use case where the \cc{printPerimeter()} function is invoked on \cc{int} without 
any compiler error, and the resulting behavior is unexpected.

To avoid similar situations, it is possible to deprecate participation 
of a constructor in type conversions, adding a word \cc{explicit} to the constructor
declaration.

\pcppsolution

The described problematic motivated the following decision. When a new constructor is created with one argument, 
it is by default declared to be explicit, a user must intentionally change it to get the type conversion 
behavior. Declaring a one argument constructor explicit is  a safer \rg{ide} behavior by default. 
This is an example improvement to classical C++ which makes
a code understood better by novices and safer for them.

\subsubsection{Copying}
\label{classcopying}

\cppproblem

In the \cpppl\ a programmer controls memory allocation fully on his/her own. This affects the way of copying for  class
instances.
In C++ the programmer should define two methods for a class: a copy constructor and an assignment operator.
These two methods work when an assignment like \cc{a = b} happens, when instances of the class are passed by value to a function, 
when one object is initialized with a value of another object and so on.

C++ serves here sometimes dangerously generating default copy constructor and assignment operator, which by default represent
a bitwise cloning of an object. This can lead to problems. For example, if a pointer value is getting copied bitwise in a second
instance and is deallocated twice in the following destructor calls.

\cpp{Need in a Custom Copy Constructor}{copydeath}

The \rl{copydeath} demonstrates a program which crashes upon execution as destructors of \cc{a} and \cc{b} are deallocating 
memory with the same address, after default copy-constructor copies the address from \cc{a} into \cc{b}.

To avoid the described problem, a programmer has to either define a proper copy-constructor or forbid copying of the objects for
the class. The same applies to the assignment operator. Many standards require the two functions to be implemented in sync, i.e. 
implementing the same semantic behavior, \cite{ooocpp}. This can be performed in an elegant way by implementing an assignment 
operator first and reusing it in  a copy-constructor.

When not providing any copying behavior it comes logical to disable also the assignment behavior. 
This is done by a trick of declaring the corresponding functions in a \cc{private} section of a class, without implementing them
(as they never get called). To visually improve on such design, specialized macros exist in 
various libraries. For example the \cc{DISALLOW\_COPY\_AND\_ASSIGN} or the \cc{Q\_DISABLE\_COPY} macros are described in 
\cite{googlecppstyle} and \cite{qobjref}. An alternative to macros approach is a use of \cc{boost::noncopyable} from the 
boost library, \cite{boost}.

The use of macros in C++ appears often in similar cases, in order to perform some language-engineering tasks to add missing
features to the language (copying or assignment deprecation in this case). Macros bear a pure textual nature, and are processed by the pre-processor. Some negative effects may 
come out:
\begin{itemize}
 
 \item A need to preprocess reduces the speed of compilation and hides the resulting code from a programmer.
 \item Macros lead to error prone programming, as no type checks are possible.
 \item Macros make code less analyzable by automatic analyzers in general.

\end{itemize}

\ms{copyable}{Hinting about Copyable and Assignable Class Properties}


The projectional editor allows for another solution, different from macros, or the use of a new library.  
In order to provide some support for a  programmer regarding the copying issue, \pcpp\ hints on a class declaration its 
assignable and copyable properties, see the \fig{copyable}, and generates by default declarations of copy-constructor and assignment operator,
when a class is created.

The copy constructor and the assignment operator are recognized by \pcpp. Two \rgp{intention} are provided on the 
\mpsid{Class} \rg{concept} to forbid or allow copying. The forbidding \rg{intention} imitates the macros mentioned 
above, but displaying and explaining the implementation to a user, see the \fig{notcopyable}. The implementation of the intention 
consists of moving the declarations of two functions to the private section of the class. The allowing \rg{intention} moves
the declarations back to the public section, or creates them. The check for implementation, provided for all methods, flags
the two declarations appropriately to finish the correct class declaration creation process, see the Section \ref{implementedcheck}.

\ms{notcopyable}{Class Made not Copyable by the \emph{Forbid Copying} Intention}

\jbmps\ supports the \pcpp\ implementation by providing read-only model accesses, special parts of the editor concept,
 see the Section \ref{mpseditor}, by which the hinting is implemented. The \rgp{intention} enabled manipulations on the \mpsid{Class} \rg{concept}, 
which made it possible to  automate the allowing or forbidding of copying/assignment, making the implementation clear 
to the user, without the use of macros or libraries. 

The whole work, a programmer needs to perform to forbid copying and assignment, consists of a call to an \rg{intention}, 
one key-stroke. There is no need to include a header file with macros, and look up the documentation for them, using 
them in a right way after (the corresponding macro requires exactly one parameter - the class name, and it has to go in 
the private class section). The boost library, \cite{boost}, providing functionality to disable copying is often considered to be too
heavy-weight to include, when it goes about compact development tasks, like the one described in this section.

% Constructors among the special meaning of creating

% Namely, if there is a constructor a class of \cc{B} from a class \cc{A}: \cc{B(A obj)} or 
% similar, any object of the class \cc{A} can participate in places, where an object of the 
% class \cc{B} is requested originally, as implicit type conversion takes place, invoking the

% Context

In embedded programming the C++ programming language is widely spread, \cite{embedlangs}. Being a general purpose 
programming language, C++ does not provide any special support for an embedded systems programmer. 

By changing  the language itself, together with a tool set for it, it is possible to get a better environment 
for specifically embedded programming. As an example, a subset of C++, called Embedded C++ can be brought, \cite{emcpp}.
The approach taken in Embedded C++, is a stripping of very many features of C++ off.

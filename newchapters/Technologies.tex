\declchap{Technologies in Use}{techno}

The C++ programming language developed through out this \MT\ is based on two technologies, which are 
introduced in this chapter. The first technology is the \jbmps\ language engineering environment, which 
provides the core foundations and means for incremental language construction. The second technology is
the \mbdp.

\declsec{The C++ Language}{cpplangitself}

This work is basically an implementation of the \cpppl\ in \jbmps. No matter, the whole work 
is about the C++ implementation, it is infeasible to describe the language in detail itself
here. Thus I give a references to literature about the language in this chapter only. Certain 
aspects of C++ are raised during the description of the C++ implementation in \jbmps\ itself in 
the \rchap{cpp}.

Various literature is available, to get acquainted with the language closer. The most complete
guide to the language, covering \rg{stl} as well is \cite{stroustrupcpp2000}. The more 
easy-to-read and more suitable for beginners book on C++ is \cite{schildtcpp}. A newer book,
oriented towards intermediate level C++ programmers and updated to the recent C++11 standard, \cite{cpp11}, and describing 
\rg{stl} as well, \cite{pratacpp}.

The collection of techniques to get more effective C++ programs is \cite{meyerseffcpp}. Templates are explained in 
detail and researched in, \cite{josuttistemplates}. The book dedicated to ad hoc polymorphism and advanced template meta programming can be 
also of interest as an approach to language engineering in a certain sense, \cite{alexandrescumeta}.

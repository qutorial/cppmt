\declsec{mbeddr Project}{mbeddr}

The \mbdp\ is a software built with the use of \jbmps. Mainly, it represents an implementation of the C programming language in the \jbmps\ environment. Having embedded systems
and software for them as the main focus, \mbdr\ provides certain language extensions to empower the programmer in 
embedded domain \cite{mbeddr-wave}, 
\cite{Voelter:MoDELS:2010}. 

Being a different from C language, the \cpppl\ shares a lot of commonality with C. 
As \jbmps\ allows, to some extent, see the Section \ref{modularity}, an incremental language construction, the \mbdrp\ represents 
a suitable basis for the \cpppl\ implementation in \jbmps\ . 

We could not  extend \mbdr\ with C++ pure incrementally. We had to perform some changes to \mbdr\ itself. 
The changes were introduced however, in a way to make \mbdr\ more extensible in general. Compare this to creating 
a separate branch of \mbdr\ designed only for C++. After such forking a separate team would have to support a newly
created \mbdr\ version for C++. By making \mbdr\ more extensible, and by building C++ as a pure extension, we keep
only one \mbdr\ version, and reduce the maintenance needed in the future, to keep C++ supported by \mbdr.

No matter the \mbdp\ has  (one) C language with extensions as an outcome, internally, as a \jbmps\ software, 
it is represented as several \jbmps\ languages.

All \mbdr\ languages are named starting from ``\mpslang{com.mbeddr.}'' string. In this document we usually omit it,
keeping the last word of the name only. For example, instead of \mpslang{com.mbeddr.expressions} we call the language 
simply \mpslang{expressions} here.

\subsection{mbeddr Expressions Language}
\label{expressionslang}

The \mpslang{expressions} language contains definitions for all expressions, possible in the \mbdr\ C language.
As in object-oriented programming languages, \rgp{concept} of the \cc{expressions} language form inheritance hierarchies. 
\jbmps\ is capable of showing a given \rg{concept} in a hierarchy. 

\msnozoom{minushierarchy}{\Rg{concept} Hierarchy Example}

The \fig{minushierarchy} shows a hierarchy for the \mpsid{MinusExpression} \rg{concept}. In a similar way all expressions of the 
C programming language are implemented in the \mpslang{expressions} language.

Whenever there is a need in the \cpppl\ to extend the C programming language with a new expression kind, like 
object member reference, \mpslang{new} expression and so on, a point of inheritance has to be found in the 
\mbdr\ \mpslang{expressions} language to base a new \rg{concept} on it.


\msnozoom{typehierarchy}{\mbdr\ Type Hierarchy Example}

Additionally, the \mpslang{expressions} language defines  C language types. 
All \rgp{concept} corresponding to C types are based (directly or indirectly) on the \mpsid{Type} \rg{concept}.
For example, the hierarchy of the \mpsid{IntType} \rg{concept} is demonstrated in \fig{typehierarchy}. 

In order to add a type to the \mbdr\ C language, one should inherit from the \mpsid{Type} \rg{concept} as well.
Such inheritance automatically allows the new type to appear at all places, where a type in general can be found
in the C language or its extensions.


\subsection{mbeddr Statements Language}

The \mbdr\ \mpslang{statements} language contains definitions for the C language statements. The \mpsid{Statement} \rg{concept} serves as a
base for inheritance, and represents by itself an empty line, or no-statement.

In order to create a new statement, like \cc{delete} statement in C++, the inheritance should start from the \mpsid{Statement} \rg{concept}.

\ms{stexprmarked}{Example of Multiple Languages Used Together}

The \mpslang{statements} language actively uses the \mpslang{expressions} language, see the \fig{stexprmarked}. In an \mbdr\ code snippet
the nodes, coming from \mpslang{statements} language, are marked green, and the nodes, coming from \mpslang{expressions} language are
marked yellow\footnote{Not marked with color is an instance of the \mpslang{Function} concept, which comes from the \mpslang{modules} language.}. As the example shows, 
\mpsid{if} statement and \mpsid{return} statement are coming from the \mpslang{statements} language,
but inside they contain, as children, expressions. This is an example of language modularity in \jbmps, used by \mbdr.

\subsection{Modules in mbeddr}
\label{mbdrmodules}

In C (and in C++ as well) there is no clear notion of a module. The \mbp\ improves on it, defining 
modules, \cite{Voelter:MoDELS:2010}. A C module is a \rg{concept}, from which a header and a .c files are generated in \mbdr.
Flagging an object (function, variable, structure, etc.) in a module as \cc{exported} causes a declaration of the object to appear
in the header file, and thus the object starts to be accessible by other modules or an external textual C code.

An issue with the C programming language is that there is one and only global namespace. The \mbp\ improves on it 
by introducing a so-called name mangling. All names of module contents are prefixed with a module name,
when generated to a C text code. Thus two objects with a same name but from different modules do
not cause a name clash when generated to a C text code.

The implementation of modules in \mbdr\ can be found in the \mpslang{modules} language. Functions are described there as well.
For the \mpsid{Function} concept example, see the \fig{stexprmarked}, the not marked with colors part.

Modules are further included into \jbmps\ \rgp{model}. \Rgp{model} correspond to one single \jbmps\ file unit.
After a programmer finishes a code in a projectional editor, \jbmps\ generates a textual C code, 
according to the rules, given by \mbdr. Each model is generated into a set of text C files.
After the files have been generated, \mbdr\ launches a compiler to get an object code.

For the purpose of the code generation and compilation, every model should have a node of \mpsid{TypeSizeConfiguration} 
and \mpsid{BuildConfiguration} \rgp{concept}. In the former, the programmer should specify all sizes for C language types, 
in the latter, the programmer should specify, how  \mbdr\ has to invoke the compiler.

\subsection{Pointers and Arrays in mbeddr}

In the \mpslang{pointers} language an array access and a pointer dereferencing expressions are defined as \rgp{concept}.
A similar syntax to them have overloaded operators with classes. Thus this language is also extended by \pcpp,
as some reuse is possible there as well. This is discussed in detail in the \rsec{operatoroverloading}.

\declsec{Other C++ Language Features}{othercppfeatures}

There are some C++ languages features, which are to be worked on with \pcpp.
In this section we briefly mention them.

\subsection{Exceptions}

Exceptions are not yet supported by \pcpp. The primitive support could be 
easily achieved by implementing \cc{try\{\}catch()} and \cc{throw} statements.

However, it represents a special task for the future, to make a special, improved over 
original C++, exceptions support. This may include:

\begin{itemize}
 \item An analysis for exceptions to be caught always, including a check for 
 correct exception typing.
 \item An \rg{informativeanalysis} to tell a user, which functions could generate
 exceptions, and the types of the exceptions should be expected.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Standard Output Stub}

Since \rg{stl} is not yet supported by \pcpp. There is no way to 
use the C++ standard output, which is very common for various C++ programs.

A special statement has been developed to provide a primitive support for the standard output stream
\cc{std::cout}. The \mpsid{cout << x} statement is capable of having every 
\jbmps\ \rg{concept} instead of \mpsid{x}. This reflects the high flexibility
of the \cc{std::cout} shift operator overloads.

This facility is designed to be replaced later by a proper calls to \rg{stl}
version for \pcpp.

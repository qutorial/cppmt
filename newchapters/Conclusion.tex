\declchap{Conclusion}{concl}

In this work we were extending \mbdr\ with the \cpppl. 

A new \rg{ide} for C++ has been created, which supports projectional editing for 
a subset of the C++ programming language. The new \rg{ide} has been designed with several goals 
in mind.

First, the \pcpp\ should serve as a modular basis for the future extensions to C++. The 
potentially possible extensions have been figured out and proposed as a future 
work.

Second, the experience of the \pcpp\ programming has to be more safe and informative,
when compared to the regular C++ programming. Various pitfalls, usual for C++ programming,
have been explained in this work, and tools have been introduced withing the new \rg{ide},
designed to compensate on the pitfalls.

While improving on the C++ programming experience, an application of analyses has been
found to be useful. Various analyses have been applied in \pcpp. The analyses have been
classified orthogonally by the purpose to \rgp{informativeanalysis} and \rgp{preventiveanalysis},
and by the running type to \rgp{analysisondemand} and \rgp{selfrunninganalysis}.


A method to support to some extent a project coding guidelines, precisely, naming conventions,
has been proposed in this work. The idea to store the project related information together 
with the source code has been formulated, its advantages have been listed.

The projectional approach to create an \rg{ide} has been compared to a traditional textual approach.
The advantages of the projectional approach have been listed. The potential problems while developing,
using and evolving a projectional \rg{ide} and a code produced by it, have been identified.

The \pcpp\ as a language has been designed, to represent in the end a complete enough subset 
of the \cpppl\ for the \rg{stl} to be recreated in it in the future. The creation of a 
projectional \rg{stl} copy was out of scope for this work, however.
The completeness of the \pcpp\ language was described in this work, and
the future work was proposed, which is going to be needed in order to support \rg{stl}.


Generalized principles of language re-engineering in a projectional \rg{ide} have been
discovered and formulated. The principles can be reused when creating an \rg{ide} for 
a language, to make the language more readable, more expressive, higher cross-platform,
and safer and more convenient to use for the programmer. 

Various language modularity and extensibility problems have been considered on 
practice while developing the \mbdr\ C++ extension. The \pcpp\ has been developed in 
such a way, that the \mbdp\ languages do not have a dependency on \pcpp, which
allows for, to a certain degree, separate development of the projects.

In parallel  while extending \mbdr\ to build a new C++ \rg{ide} the facilities 
for extensibility, provided be \jbmps\ were researched. Extensibility has been 
analyzed separately for each view on the language. Whenever the degree of extensibility 
was not considered to be high, workaround and future \jbmps\ improvements were proposed.
for \jbmps.

The question of building analyses in \jbmps\ for a new language has been discussed.
Three phases of analysis running were identified, and for each phase potential problems
were highlighted. \jbmps\ improvements have been proposed to make the analysis creation 
more productive.

Finally the potential future work has been described, including the ways to get the full C++ language 
support, the need to test the new \rg{ide} on practice, the problem to create an importer for the
textual C++ code and its potential complications have been described.
